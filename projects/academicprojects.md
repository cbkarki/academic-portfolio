  <li> <h2>Central Limit Theorem Visualizer </h2>
<p>This Shiny application provides an interactive visualization of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using different population distributions.
Users can explore how the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases; regardless of the population distribution.

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the foundation results in probability and statistics.
It simpler words, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, the distribution of sample means tends to be approximately normal when the sample size (n) is sufficiently large.

This app helps users see this idea in action through interactive sampling and visualization.

  <li> <h2> PI (Ï€)</h2>
  <p>
    An R Shiny project that uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of \(\pi \). The application generates a user-defined number of random points within a square and calculates the ratio of points that fall within an inscribed circle, providing a real-time, visual approximation of \(\pi \). For simplicity the demostration is performed in quarter circle in first quardent.
