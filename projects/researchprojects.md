This is an R package for binary classification problems for both low and high dimensional highly correlated data. Two main objectives of this method are featrues selection and outliers detection.
The method is under construction and being tested with comprehensive simulation studies as well as real world datasets such as NCI-60, Parkinson's, etc. Moreover, I am working on manuscript to put this method together which will also be a part of my dissertation. The method will be public in GitHub.  Stay tunned for updates!!
