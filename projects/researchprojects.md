  <li> <h2>RobENetLog</h2>
<p>This is an R package for binary classification problems for both low and high dimensional highly correlated data. Two main objectives of this method are featrues selection and outliers detection.
The method is under construction and being tested with comprehensive simulation studies as well as real world datasets such as NCI-60, Parkinson's, etc. Moreover, I am working on manuscript to put this method together which will also be a part of my dissertation. The method will be public in GitHub.  Stay tunned for updates!! The project is under construction. The updates will be availabe <a href = "https://github.com/cbkarki/Projects/tree/main/RobENetLog">here</a>.

<h2> Hybrid Ion Treatment </h2>
<p>Fast and accurate calculations of the electrostatic features of highly charged biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and highly charged proteins are crucial and challenging tasks. Traditional implicit solvent methods calculate the electrostatic features quickly, but these methods are not able to balance the high net biomolecular charges effectively. Explicit solvent methods add unbalanced ions to neutralize the highly charged biomolecules in molecular dynamic simulations, which require more expensive computing resources. Here we report developing a novel method, Hybridizing Ions Treatment (HIT), which hybridizes the implicit solvent method with an explicit method to realistically calculate the electrostatic potential for highly charged biomolecules. HIT utilizes the ionic distribution from an explicit method to predict the bound ions. The bound ions are then added in the implicit solvent method to perform the electrostatic potential calculations. In this study, two training sets were developed to optimize parameters for HIT. The performance on the testing set demonstrates that HIT significantly improves the electrostatic calculations. Results on molecular motors myosin and kinesin reveal some mechanisms and explain some previous experimental findings. HIT can be widely used to study highly charged biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, molecular motors, and other highly charged biomolecules.

  <h2> Structure Manipulation Tools</h2>
<p>Studying biomolecular interactions is a crucial but challenging task. Due to their large scales, many biomolecular interactions are difficult to be simulated via all atom models. An effective approach to investigate the biomolecular interactions is highly demanded in many areas. Here we introduce a Structure Manipulation (StructureMan) program to operate the structures when studying the large-scale biomolecular interactions. This novel StructureMan tool provides comprehensive operations which can be utilized to study the interactions in various large biological systems. Combining with electrostatic calculation programs such as DelPhi and DelPhiForce, StructureMan was implemented to reveal the detailed electrostatic features in two large biological examples, the viral capsid and molecular motor-microtubule complexes. Applications on these two examples revealed interesting binding mechanisms in the viral capsid and molecular motor. Such applications demonstrated that the StructureMan can be widely used when studying the biomolecular interactions in large scale biological problems. This novel tool provides an alternative approach to efficiently study the biomolecular interactions, especially for large scale biology systems.
