<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>
My name is Chitra Karki. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Data Science at the University of Texas at El Paso, focused on developing novel statistical and machine learning methods 
  for analyzing complex modern day complex data. I also work on computational and bioinformatics approaches to study pathogen-related proteins, their interactions, and dynamics.
  My work combines programming (R, Python, Bash, C), modeling, and simulation to uncover insights from challenging biological systems.
 <br><br>

I maintain a list of my publications, research projects, and implementations under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other projects under 
  the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You can also check out my <a href="https://github.com/cbkarki">GitHub profile</a> for code and tools.<br><br>

For a comprehensive overview of my work, you can view my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. 
<!--  I also share occasional blog posts on research and computational methods <a href="/blog">here</a>. -->
