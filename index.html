<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>
My name is Chitra Karki, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Data Science at the University of Texas at El Paso. My research focuses on pathogen-related proteins, their interactions, and applying computational and statistical methods to understand virulence mechanisms. I also work on developing bioinformatics tools and implementing machine learning techniques for biological data.<br><br>

I maintain a list of my publications, research projects, and implementations under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You can also check out my <a href="https://github.com/cbkarki">GitHub profile</a> for code and tools.<br><br>

For a comprehensive overview of my work, you can view my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I also share occasional blog posts on research and computational methods <a href="/blog">here</a>. To learn more about my background and interests, check out the <a href="/about">About Me</a> page.</p>
